Revision history for CGI::EncryptForm

1.01 1999-10-20

	- Removed dependancy on Math::TrulyRandom because of portability issues.
    Replaced random number generator with perl's builtin rand(). Given
    the purpose of this module, I believe rand() will surfice.
    If you disagree make me understand why and I will look into it further.
